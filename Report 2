Tech Stack used till now: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript

Till now I'm done with logo designing, navbar, landing page, about us page (with lorem ipsum, will update the content soon) & currently working on products section.

The image I've used from Unsplash are of high quality & due to that the page is taking a bit longer to load. I'll try to reduce the file size as much as possible.

To do :
  (1) Images & Menu
  (2) Footer & business location
  (3) Some improvisation or any changes if required
