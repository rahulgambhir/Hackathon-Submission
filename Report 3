Tech Stack used till now: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript

Till now I'm done with logo designing, navbar, landing page, about us page, product page, contact us page & footer. Currently I'm working on Menu section.

I've used https://coverr.co/ for free stock/royalty free video.

For icons, I've used https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/

For business location, I've embeded code from google maps.

To do :
  (1) Menu
  (2) Update more products
  (3) Some improvisation or any changes, if required
